Electronic Literature

On Electronic Literature
Electronic literature has the potential to be a progressive platform that changes our world. It is mostly accessible by a large audience and the possibilities haven’t even been fully explored. On one hand there is a tradition of activism in electronic literature and on the other hand there is the exploitation of unregulated media by those who seek to perform psychological operations. I will dive into specific works that exemplify how electronic literature can be useful for the world, while also exploring the darker potential of electronic media.
	One artist in particular that I am interested in is Zoe Quinn. Quinn’s Depression Quest is known for being part of the gamergate controversy. It is a game made using branched narratives and its purpose is to familiarize people with the different elements of depression. Her work forces the player to enter the shoes of a depressed person and creates empathy towards the topic as the player maneuvers through different situations. The branched narrative is a great way to have the player step outside of their own perspective in order to entertain a new one. Quinn’s work is important in dispeling social stigma around mental illnesses such as depression or social anxiety. The game is available for free and a portion of the donations are given to The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The controversy that arose around the author itself can be seen as an important event in feminism. The following quote shows how women are typically excluded from the gaming culture:“Games like Myst and the Sims still had largely female playerships, but shooter games began to dominate the public conception of what a video game was.” The gaming world is full of misogyny and bias towards women and in many ways excludes them. Many people, predominantly men, were afraid that Quinn’s work was infiltrating the gaming world in order to politicize it. Unfortunately, the dark side of the internet had organized itself in order to harass Quinn for a myriad of things ranging from gaming to slut-shaming. This created an interesting situation in politics in which the proper regulations are currently lacking-- propaganda: 

Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman who served as the connection between the alt-right and the White House, has said that he was struck by the power of “rootless white males” on websites about World of Warcraft (which he’d learned about by investing in a firm that sought to profit off the kind of “gold farming” that Quinn’s ex-husband had done) and actively thought about how to co-opt their potential. Gradually, many of the accounts that had been obsessed with Quinn and ethics in video-game journalism changed their avatars to Pepe the Frog, tweeted about #MAGA, and explored white nationalism. (Malone 2017)

The 2016 campaign was unprecedented in terms of the GOP’s strategy. Using the virality of the internet, misinformation was spread around certain topics in order to sew division. This created a situation in which people with reactionary views are unified in opposition against feminism and other minority movements that sit further apart on the left. I find this to be important for the reasons that we must quickly employ systems for regulating misinformation and propaganda as we move forward in an ever-changing internet world if we are to value our democracy’s integrity. 
	Another work I am interested in was created by !Mediengruppe Bitnik. The random Darknet Shopper was designed to surf the dark web and purchase items with a budget of $100. The bot makes a precarious shopping journey buying things from shoes to DVD’s and even illicit drugs. The darknet is a place where anonymous trade can take place-- a black market for clandestine activity.  If the bot was a regular person who exhibited their purchases in an art space, they would have likely been held accountable for their actions. In fact, autonomy was an important foundation for the artists to work with: 
“We also like to introduce an element of losing control. So with these bots we create, like the Random Darknet Shopper, there is a certain randomness, or autonomy, to them, so that they can be separate from us and they can take action separately from us.”
This brings up questions about how bots need to be regulated and if programmers should be held accountable for the autonomous things that they create. As an art piece, the random darknet shopper shines a light on a seedy underbelly of the internet that is not accessed or even acknowledged by the general public. What is interesting to me is not that the darknet creates a place for a black market to exist, but the idea that it exposes and puts on display an already existing structure of illegal activity. Again, I find the piece an important tool for developing the proper regulations as we move forward as a society. 
	Eugenio Tiselli’s “The Gate” is an interactive game in which the world is represented through emojis. It is a work of art that’s purpose seems to be activism concerning the climate. The game directs you to listen to the animals as you maneuver through the simulated forest. Its point seems to be about proximity to nature-- the temperature rises and falls depending on your actions. The game is a work made with an ecological perspective in which we humans need to be less alienated from nature. 
Tiselli’s other work, “Amazon”, provides a code that can be placed into any word processor and opened as an HTML file that will then simulate the destruction of the amazon forest. The destruction of the text increases with time and eventually nothing is left. The website has a cheeky description: “what is destroying the forest? it is the capitalist algorithm, executed by fascist war-men/machines. remove the algorithm from bodies and minds, smash the killer machines!” The user is left with a catastrophic perspective of how deforestation can go. 
	Electronic literature is a term we use to describe some things that in my opinion are proto technologies. We as a society are exploring the benefits, downfalls and even just the possibilities of machines, artificial intelligence and the systems they operate around. This experimental phase of technology allows for electronic literature to be more open ended and less utilitarian than traditional works. Many of the works I discussed are important pieces of art that act as platforms for activism, representation and creativity. The ways in which electronic literature are useful are endless and so we must encourage healthy habits as opposed to using the media as a tool for malintent. Whether it be about minorities rights such as women being represented in gaming, mental illness, consumerism or even climate change, electronic literature is capable of making society reflect upon these situations.

Lyrical and Modern Poetry
Spring 2018
			Exile in 19th and 20th Century Poetry

The cultural movements of modernity are often characterized as being created amidst a change in ideologies that were brought on by The Great War and the Industrial Revolution. Just as artists of the Romantic era began to reject the logical positivism of the Enlightenment, Modernism rejected conventions even further and began to break away from the traditional aesthetics found in art. Through new developments in syntax, narrative and form Modern poets were able to create works in which these conventions were disrupted.
The work of Charles Baudelaire is a great example of a poet that aims to explore a cultural void that was brought on by the unprecedented growth in technology as well as the unfathomable amount of death that the first world war resulted in. Baudelaire felt that the poetry commonly shared in French salons was becoming increasingly irrelevant and that poets should aim to create art that had a more contemporary element. Rather than depending on the traditions of Enlightenment and ancient poetry, he wanted to create new forms of expression. In his essay, “On the Heroism of Modern Life”, he writes: 
“The life of our city is rich in poetic and marvelous subjects. We are enveloped and steeped as though in an atmosphere of the marvelous; but we do not notice it...The themes and resources of painting equally abundant and varied; but there is a new element - modern beauty.”
 He argues that the modern man is just as heroic as the ancient gladiator and so on. This early essay echoes the attempt of Modernity to break away from the past while also showing that it can not do so entirely. 
In his poem Le Cygne Baudelaire uses Ancient Greek figures as well as a swan to express the exile felt in a rapidly changing France: 

Andromaque, I think of you! 
This little stream, Poor and sad mirror where formerly shone
The immense majesty of your widow’s sorrows, 
This lying Simoïs who by your tears grew, 

Has inundated suddenly my fertile memory, 
As I was traversing the new Carrousel. 
Old Paris is no more (the form of a town 
Changes more quickly, alas! than the heart of a mortal)

For Baudelaire, his sense of time is one that is both outside the past as well as the present which is expressed in the last two lines:“Old Paris is no more… Changes more quickly… than the heart of a mortal…”In Walter Benjamin’s “On Some Motifs in Baudelaire” he describes Baudelaires participation in temporality as such:
 “The poet does not participate in the game. He stays in his corner, no happier than those who are playing. He too has been cheated out of his experience-a modern man. The only difference is that he rejects the narcotics the gamblers use to dull the consciousness that has forced them to march to the beat of the second-hand.”

In “Le Cygne” the people are the gamblers and the narcotics are the new and “improved” buildings and boulevards of France. These people buy into this new account of France as they “..march to the beat of the second-hand.” They move with the duration of time while Baudelaire rejects the new facades as the sole existence of France. Estranged from temporality, he is able to reflect on the destruction and rebirth of France. He repeatedly makes references to Andromaque, a widow that was captured by Pyrrhus after the fall of Troy and this speaks to Baudelaire’s themes of exile.  A stream described as a “Poor and sad mirror” brings to mind the idea that we are aware of our own appearance through a reflection, which in turn is a distance from something that is actually outside of us which creates an exiled representation of ourselves. For a person in Modernity, increasing urbanization led familiar places to change. Baudelaire expresses the rapid development of France through the imagery of changing Boulevards and buildings, all the while his memory works in opposition to this as it recalls the relationships he once had with these spaces:


There, before, there was a menagerie;                    
There, I saw, one morning, at the hour when beneath the sky 
Cold and clear Work rises, when the roads 
Blow a dark hurricane into the silent air, 

Initially, he recalls that there was once a menagerie in a particular spot; this image takes place in his thoughts. Then, he describes seeing “Work rises” which invokes an image of buildings and construction--this description is seen with his eyes in the physical world. The account of history he has created in his mind is now outside of reality as that history no longer exists in the physical world and this expresses the exiled condition of his thoughts. The poet is now distanced from normal society as he reflects upon it from the outside. 
Exile is again echoed in the image of a menagerie. A menagerie is a place for foreign animals to be placed on exhibition which means that they are no longer wild. Their captivity is of an exiled existence. His next image of exile rather than an allusion to the ancients, is a more commonplace image that is the swan.

A swan that had escaped from its cage,
And, with its webbed feet rubbing the dry pavement, 
Was dragging its white feathers on the rough ground.
Near a stream without water the animal, opening its beak, 

Nervously bathed its wings in the powder,
And said, its heart full with the beautiful lake of its birth:
“Water, when will you rain? lightning when will you thunder?”
 I see this unfortunate, this strange and fatal myth, 

The swan is placed on the ground and not in the water which places it outside of its usual environment.  The swan’s exile from the water is marked by its memories of bathing in the water and its nervousness is derived from its memory of the water. Just as a person placed in exile needs a memory of home in order to truly feel estranged. Since the swan is used in opposition to Andromaque, its personification makes them equal which in turn diminishes the importance of Ancient references. While Baudelaire sought to disrupt tradition in poetry, his use of Andromaque as an allegory for exile shows that his desire gives way to convention as he simultaneously uses the allegorical character of the swan to break away from it. 
Similarly, the 20th century poet, Adonis, sought to draw on Arabic mythology while also disrupting it as a foundation for his poetry. Adonis uses Arabic for secular poetry and this in itself breaks from the historical use of Arabic as it is nearly inseparable from religious connotations after the advent of Islam. Many of his themes come from a rebellion against the totalitarian nature of his culture. Naturally, he writes of exile since he was forced out of Syria to Beirut and Paris. Focusing on the function of language Adonis claims: 
“To be means to mean something. Meanings are only apprehended through words. I speak; therefore, I am. My existence thus and then assumes meaning. It is through this distance and hope that the Arab poet attempts to speak…”
Adonis puts emphasis on the idea that without language we can not iterate our existence, yet it is outside of us. There is a distance between the language we use to describe ourselves such as the word “I” and our actual existence therefore, our existence is also of an experience of exilement.  Adonis relates to his exilement in his poem titled “Elegy in Exile”: 

Phoenix,
when the flames enfolded you,
what pen were you holding?
What feathers sprouted 
when your old ones burned?
Buried in your own ashes,
what world did you confront,
what robe did you don?
what color did you choose?

Adonis’ experience of exile is parallel to the Phoenix's. A person who has been exiled, just like a Phoenix who is reborn from its own ashes, lives through their own death in terms of culture. The last three lines of the poem show the struggle one faces when they must create a new life for themselves in a distant location. 
	Both Adonis’ and Baudelaire’s poetry treat existence in Modernity as an experience of distance, estrangement and exile. Their poetry uses tradition and disrupts it in order to create something new altogether. For these poets, they are estranged from the very societies they belong to. Through the use of new forms, opposition and a disruption in an understanding of time as genetic, these two poets were able to express the condition of modern man.

Twitter Bot

Hyperlink to bot:  https://twitter.com/bot21733540


My twitter bot began as a simple one. Originally it was meant to be a parody of René Magritte. As the code got more complex and more values were added, the harder it became to control the outcomes. My bot started with a rigorous structure that was based around the value: "The revolution will be #pastverb#. But then it was changed to: "The #noun2# will be #pastverb#. Formerly, my bot could only tweet a variation of the Magritte line and a single line from Gil Scott Heron. I felt like it was cool, but that I wanted to give the bot more autonomy. Adding more symbols and rules allowed for the bot to break out of the structure and now the question was: “How to make it make sense?”. I thought about reductionist practices and chose to build the origin by making minimalist sentences and fixing a few of the key elements while making others into symbols. I noticed that these simpler sentences invoke ambiguity and are a lot more successful as art/poetry. The tweet “A thought became.” derived from "A #noun# #verb1#.", is more successful to me as poetry than: “A barista paints and the thought takes its dream.” which is derived from "The #noun# #verb1# its #noun2#. The purpose of my bot is to just experiment with language and the human tendency to make sense of or interpret meaning. """

Meditation VI
Descartes’ discussion of the chiliagon is designed to reveal a difference between two faculties of the human mind. What are these faculties and what is the difference Descartes reveals?
The two faculties are imagination and pure intellection. Intellect does not depend on the imagination. When imagining a chiliagon one cannot distinguish it from their imagination of some other myriagon, however, one can clearly and distinctly understand what a chiliagon is.   

Descartes says that his power of imagining is “not a necessary constituent of my own essence” What is it about the power of imagination that disqualifies is as necessary to the essence of the ‘thinking thing’, and what is necessary to it?
	Descartes believes that the faculty of imagination originates from bodily aspects and he believes the mind is a thinking thing that is separate from these aspects. What is necessary to the essence of a thinking thing is the intellect. 
In the ninth paragraph Descartes argues that the mind (thinking thing) and body (material thing) associated with him and with other human beings are distinct. What is his justification for this claim?
	He argues that he clearly perceives a distinct difference between the soul and the body. He also argues that the soul can exist without a body since they don't share essential qualities. 
In the tenth paragraph Descartes offers an argument to the conclusion that ‘corporeal things exist’. What are the premises in this argument, as you understand it?
	He believes that he has adventitious ideas about te corporeal things and that he naturally thinks the ideas originate from the corporeal. Since God is not deceiving him, corporeal things must exist.
In the long fifteenth paragraph of Meditation VI, where Descartes discusses what we know by nature and how we know things known by means of our nature, he tells us what the ‘proper purpose’ of sense perceptions is. What is that purpose?
Descartes claims that sensory perceptions are there to “inform the mind of what is beneficial or harmful”. 

In the last third of the sixth meditation Descartes tells us that a human being is a composite entity, one consisting of two radically different finite substances, one mental, one material, that exist “very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled”. Given the radical difference between these two substances, and the states of each at any given time, how does Descartes account for the obvious fact that states of one can produces effects in the other (the mind can affect the body, as when I choose to lift my right index finger, and the body can affect the mind, as when I open my eyes and see my cat Chloe eagerly awaiting her morning meal)?
Descartes points to the wit or common sense : “I further notice that the mind does not receive the impressions from all parts of the body immediately, but only from the brain, or perhaps even from one of its smallest parts, to wit, from that in which the common sense is said to reside, which, whenever it is disposed in the same particular way, conveys the same thing to the mind, although meanwhile the other portions of the body may be differently disposed, as is testified by innumerable experiments which it is unnecessary here to recount.


At the very end of this meditation Descartes reconsiders the dream problem and decides that there is, after all, a way to eliminate the concern that my reasons for believing what my waking perceptions incline me to believe are no better than my reasons for believing what my vivid dream perceptions incline me to believe. What is the basis for his solution to this problem?
	He argues that in his waking life he his memory can connect the present with the past and that dreams do not share this quality. The perceptions presented in dreams are not distinct and are not connected through memory. Again, Descartes claims that God is not a deceiver and he is perfectly assured of the distinction between waking life and sleep.
